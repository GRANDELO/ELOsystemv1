That's why we've been working hard to improve observability into app and network metrics for your Render services.\n\nAs a result of that work, today we're releasing a **newly enhanced Metrics page** in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com):\n\n\u003cvideo autoplay loop muted controls width=\"700\"\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"https://render.com/images/metrics-page.mp4\"/\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nThe Metrics page now displays more in-depth views into your app's compute resources and HTTP traffic. On the compute side, you can inspect memory, CPU, and persistent disk usage for your services. If you're running a service with multiple instances, you can view metrics on a per-instance basis or in aggregate. With this additional level of detail, you can isolate performance issues to a particular instance, helping you make more informed decisions about how you design your app and whether you should scale its instance count.\n\nFor network metrics, you can now view HTTP request volume for your web services, which you can segment by response code. With the Team plan or above, you can also inspect HTTP response times, and you can filter by request domain or path.\n\nThe page also provides visibility into outbound bandwidth usage for web services and static sites. \n\nAll of these graphs support custom time ranges (up to 7 days for individuals, up to 14 or 30 days for teams depending on plan). When you identify an area of interest, you can drag over it to zoom in for a closer look:\n\n\u003cvideo autoplay loop muted controls width=\"700\"\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"https://render.com/images/metrics-zoom.mp4\"/\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nDelve into your service's performance with the new Metrics page and let us know what you think! If you have any feedback or suggestions, don't hesitate to [reach out in our community](https://community.render.com/) or [submit a feature request](https://feedback.render.com/).\n\n\u003cdiv
